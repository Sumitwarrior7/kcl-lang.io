# KusionStack

**KusionStack is an open-source cloud-native programmable technology stack!**

KusionStack is a highly flexible programmable technology stack to enable unified application delivery and operation, inspired by the word Fusion, which aims to help enterprises build an application-centric configuration management plane and DevOps ecosystem.

1. Fusion of hybrid scenarios of **private cloud**, **hybrid cloud**, and **multi-cloud**
2. Fusion of hybrid platform technologies of **cloud-native** and a variety of other platform technologies
3. Fusion of enterprise-level demands of **multi-project**, **multi-team**, **multi-role**, **multi-tenant**, and **multi-environment**

Based on the concept of Platform as Code, developers can quickly unify the full configuration schemas, constraints, policies and configs across the application life cycle, work with the **hybrid technologies and cloud environment**, go through the **end-to-end workflow** from programming to launching, and truly achieve **write once, deliver anywhere**.
