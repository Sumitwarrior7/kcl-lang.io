## Introduction

In KCL, we can not only compile and output the configuration code written by KCL into YAML format data, but also directly embed JSON/YAML and other data into the KCL language.

## Use KCL for Data Integration

### 0. Prerequisite

- Install [KCL](https://kcl-lang.io/docs/user_docs/getting-started/install)

### 1. Get the Example

Firstly, let's get the example.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-lang.io.git/
cd ./kcl-lang.io/examples/data-integration
```

### 2. YAML Integration

We can run the following command to show the YAML integration config.

```bash
cat yaml.k
```

```python
import yaml

schema Server:
    ports: [int]

server: Server = yaml.decode("""\
ports:
- 80
- 8080
""")
server_yaml = yaml.encode({
    ports = [80, 8080]
})
```

In the above code, we use the built-in `yaml` module of KCL and its `yaml.decode` function directly integrates YAML data, and uses the `Server` schema to directly verify the integrated YAML data. In addition, we can use `yaml.encode` to serialize YAML data. We can obtain the configuration output through the following command:

```shell
kcl yaml.k
```

The output is

```yaml
server:
  ports:
    - 80
    - 8080
server_yaml: |
  ports:
    - 80
    - 8080
```

In addition, KCL supports using the `file` module to read data from files, allowing you to read YAML data from files and make further operations and modifications.

```python
import file
import yaml

deployment = yaml.decode(file.read("deployment.yaml")) | {
    metadata.name = "override_name"
}
```

### 3. JSON Integration

Similarly, for JSON data, we can use `json.encode` and `json.decode` function performs data integration in the same way.

We can run the following command to show the JSON integration config.

```bash
cat json.k
```

```python
import json

schema Server:
    ports: [int]

server: Server = json.decode('{"ports": [80, 8080]}')
server_json = json.encode({
    ports = [80, 8080]
})
```

The output of the execution command is:

```shell
kcl json.k
```

```yaml
server:
  ports:
    - 80
    - 8080
server_json: '{"ports": [80, 8080]}'
```

## Summary

This document introduces how to perform data integration in KCL, using the built-in yaml and json modules to directly integrate YAML and JSON data into the KCL language, and verify and serialize it using the corresponding decoding and encoding functions.
